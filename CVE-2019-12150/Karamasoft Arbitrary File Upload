[Description]

> UltimateEditor 1 does not ensure that an uploaded file is an image or document
> (neither file types nor extensions are restricted). The attacker must use the Attach icon to perform an upload.
> An uploaded file is accessible under the UltimateEditorInclude/UserFiles/ URI.
> 
> ------------------------------------------
> This vulnerability lets me upload arbitrary files to the file system.
> UltimateEditor's upload path does not restrict file types/extensions
> and because of this, was able to upload PHP5 and ASPX files on their
> file system. Using the ASPX shell, I was able to execute codes on the
> targets server. I was able to exploit this vulnerability on
> karamasoft's website itself >> https://www.karamasoft.com . Here are
> the steps of the exploitation:

  [Exploitation]

>     Go to www.karamasoft.com, click UltimateEditor on their homepage.
>     Now, click the Live Demo. 
>     Click the Attach icon on the UltimateEditor and a small window should pop up.
>     Click browse then file system would pop up and shows the upload path.
>     upload your ASPX shell.
> 
> Now here is a slightly tricky part.
> 
>     Click your ASPX shell. It doesn't preview right ?
>     To solve this problem, click one of the uploaded images. It previews.
>     Now, right click on the image and click view image. Then it shows you the file path.
> 
> File Path:
> https://www.karamasoft.com/UltimateEditorInclude/UserFiles/Desert.jpg
> 
>     erase the image file name and replace it with the name + extension of your shell. 
> 
> Example:
> 
> https://www.karamasoft.com/UltimateEditorInclude/UserFiles/shell.aspx
> 
>     Gratz! You now have a shell access on the website/server.
